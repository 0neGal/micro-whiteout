Install with: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0neGuyDev/micro-whiteout/main/install.sh | sh`

Or manually place the `.micro` colorscheme file in your colorschemes folder.

This theme is a collection and part of my overall setup, currently this is the only part of it that's released.
The colorscheme in the images are from [Tomorrow](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme) running on GNOME Terminal with picom as the compositor and Roboto Mono as the font.

I'm currently in the works of finishing the GTK theme and also my lemonbar config, however I don't quite have an estimate, actually I'm not even close to having one :p
I've also been finishing my Firefox theme and other themes for certain websites, that is I've been making CSS code which get's injected into websites, either through Firefox's own feature to do so or an extension like Stylish.

I might follow up on those things later on.

The script on the terminal in the front is something I've been working on as a helper for qemu, I might release that as well.
